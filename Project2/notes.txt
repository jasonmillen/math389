-rule has to have size two at least for one bit or else sequenze size will never change

-opposites seem to work

fixed points:
0 -> 01
1 -> 0
seed: 0
-----------
0 -> 01
1 -> 10
seed: 0
-----------
rule['0'] = "1";
rule['1'] = "10";

string seed = "1";

--------------------

rule['0'] = "01";
rule['1'] = "10";

string seed = "1";
